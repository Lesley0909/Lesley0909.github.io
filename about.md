I am currently a third year PhD candidate in Marketing at Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management. My research interest is Consumer Behavior. I started my academic career in Organizational Behavior, with a Bachelor's degree in Human Resource Management from Xiamen University. Outside of behavioral experiments, I like learning about empirical methods for casual inference, innovations in Neuroscience, and symphony.
